<h1>Getting started with datasources</h1>

<h2>What is a datasource?</h2>

<p><strong>Datasources</strong> bring normalized content to the factory. A datasource returns a feed of items from the cloud. Items may describe just about anything, from blog posts to persons, locations or videos.</p>

<p>Content normalization ensures that templates can integrate data from different content providers: a picture from <em>content provider A</em> (e.g. Flickr) shares the same structure as another one from <em>content provider B</em> (e.g. Tumblr), so a template does not need to process pictures from <em>A</em> or <em>B</em> any differently. Items returned by datasources are normalized following the <a href="http://schema.org">schema.org</a> structure, extended with additional properties and types when necessary.</p>

<p>Feeds do not have size constraints. Typical feeds return 20-100 items.</p>


<h2>Why develop a datasource?</h2>

<p>You may want to develop a datasource if you are a content provider willing to expose an existing API to factory templates and take advantage of the increased exposure. You may be a service provider willing to sell services based on content and willing to expose that content to templates. You may also be a template developer willing to take advantage of common data processing libraries exposed by the factory to integrate content in a template from a service that is not yet featured in the factory.</p>

<h2>Anatomy of a datasource</h2>

<p>At a minimum, a datasource is a JavaScript module defined with the <a href="https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD">Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD) API</a> mechanism that exposes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a <code>find</code> method that takes query options as parameter and a callback function that gets called with the normalized items retrieved from the remote content provider when request is over</li>
  <li>a <code>desc</code> property that describes configuration options for the factory</li>
</ul>

<p>A datasource runs <code>client-side</code> when possible, server-side if not. Client-side execution is usually not possible when the application runs in a regular browser if the datasource needs to issue cross-origin requests, unless JSONP can be used or unless a mechanism such as <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</a> is setup.</p>

<p><a href="/doc/develop/datasources">Datasources</a> and <a href="/doc/develop/options">configuration settings</a> selected by users are exposed to templates through a <code>Joshfire.factory</code> global object.</p>

<h2>A minimal datasource</h2>

<p>A minimal "Hello world!" datasource is a single JavaScript file of the form:</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">define([], function () {
  return {
    // Description of the datasource
    desc: {
      "options": {
        "schema": {
          "user": {
            "title": "User name",
            "type": "string",
            "required": true,
            "default": "man"
          }
        }
      },
      "runAtClient": "enable"
    },

    // Returns a single Hello World item
    // Note items are returned as an array in an "entries" property
    find: function (query, callback) {
      var user = query.filter.user;
      return callback(null, {
        entries: [
          {
            "@type": "Thing",
            "name": "Hello " + user
          }
        ]
      });
    }
  };
});</code></pre>

<p>This datasource uses a single item whose title is a "hello" message based on the the option value to return a "Hello" returns only one item whose title is based on the configuration value. As for the minimal template example, this example is essentially useless. The <a href="/doc/datasources/prepare">datasource documentation</a> explains how to develop and integrate useful datasources.</p>
