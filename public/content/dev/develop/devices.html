<h1>Support multiple devices</h1>

<h2>Families of devices</h2>

<p>Screen size, user interaction methods, usage may be very different from one class of devices to the other. For instance, mobile phones have a smaller touchscreen, no keyboard or mouse, and are typically used on the go. TVs have larger screens although seen from a distance in a lean-back position.</p>

<p>The factory uses the notion of families to differentiate between classes of devices. Criteria used to differentiate between families are by essence ill-defined. Sure enough, desktops may be used on the go, and TVs may serve in a showroom.</p>

<h3>Phone</h3>

<p>The smartphone you have in your pocket. Main criteria to tell a phone from other types of devices:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Small screen, typically <em>4.5cm/1.8in wide</em></li>
  <li>User interaction methods: touchscreen, lack of keyboard and mouse</li>
  <li>Constrained environment: processing power, memory, bandwidth</li>
  <li>Running on batteries</li>
  <li>Used on the go</li>
  <li>May feature sensors and additional devices (e.g. GPS, accelerometer, camera)</li>
  <li>Less advanced support for Web technologies than desktops</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tablet</h3>

<p>Basically, you know you have a tablet in your hand and not a phone when the device doesn't fit. Main criteria to tell a tablet from a phone:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Larger screen, typically <em>15cm/6in wide</em></li>
  <li>Larger bandwidth available (often used over Wi-Fi)</li>
</ul>


<h3>TV</h3>

<p>The usual family television. Main criteria that identify a TV:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Large screen seen from a distance (<em>10 foot user interface</em>)</li>
  <li>User interaction method: remote controller</li>
  <li>Constrained environment: processing power, memory</li>
  <li>Plugged in</li>
  <li>Used in a lean-back position</li>
  <li>Less advanced support for Web technologies</li>
</ul>

<h3>Desktop</h3>
<p>Your desktop, your laptop, in short the usual personal computer you use to develop your template.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Medium-sized screens</li>
  <li>User interaction methods: keyboard, mouse</li>
  <li>Plugged in</li>
  <li>Used for work and leisure</li>
  <li>Most advanced support for Web technologies</li>
</ul>

<h3>Object</h3>

<p>The object family features experimental connected objects, including <a href="http://joshfire.com/showcase/">prototypes</a> such as interactive mirrors or connected radios. Experimental objects may or may not have a screen, a mouse or a battery. What binds them together is that they can run Web applications.</p>

<p>Future versions of the factory may refine the object family, in particular to introduce additional levels.</p>


<h2>Assert support for families of devices</h2>

<p>Templates apply to all families of devices by default. One of the goals of the factory is to ensure Web applications reach users whereever they are regardless of the device they use. It is good practice to ensure your template works well on typical devices of the different families.</p>

<p>That said, depending on the scenario that your template addresses, it may actually be a good idea to support only a restricted set of families. For instance, a template that exposes a quick « Next agenda item » functionality may only make sense on mobile phones. Similarly, a template that proposes to watch a TV series along with information on the charaters it features could specifically target TVs.</p>

<p>Asserting support for a given family of devices does not only mean that your template "works" on typical devices of this family. It means that your template offers a good user experience on these devices. For instance, a template that renders blog posts may well "work" on a TV, but the TV is not a medium where you would expect users to read content, so the template would not propose a good enough experience.</p>

<p>Whatever you decide, you should clarify supported families in the manifest file, adjusting the <a href="/doc/ref/package#devices">devices</a> section and the <a href="/doc/ref/package#description">description</a> of your template.</p>

<p>The following section would assert support for phones and TV:</p>
<pre><code class="json">"devices": [
  {
    "devices": "phone",
    "startfile": "app/index.phone.html",
    <em>[...]</em>
  },
  {
    "devices": "tv",
    "startfile": "app/index.tv.html",
    <em>[...]</em>
  }
]</code></pre>

<p>The same <a href="/doc/develop/start">template entry point</a> may be used for different families of devices.  The device's family identified when the Web application starts is exposed to the JavaScript code in <a href="/doc/ref/templateapi#device"><code class="json">Joshfire.factory.device</code></a></p>
