<h1>Bind to datasources</h1>

<p>The factory focuses on the generation of <strong>content-based</strong> Web applications. This content comes from datasource feeds. A number of datasource connectors are available in the factory. Users can select and configure datasources they want to expose in their Web application in a few clicks.</p>

<p>As template developer, it is your responsibility to integrate these datasources in the resulting Web application while ensuring the user experience remains good on supported families of devices (which we'll address <a href="/doc/develop/devices">next</a>).</p>


<h2>Define datasources inputs</h2>

<p>Your first task is to define the datasources inputs that factory users should set to apply your template in their Web application. To do so, simply fill out the <a href="/doc/ref/package#datasources">datasources</a> section in the manifest file.</p>

<p>Pay attention to the <a href="/doc/ref/package#datasource-title">title</a> and <a href="/doc/ref/package#datasource-description">description</a> of the datasource input to guide users when they set datasources. The description should provide an indication of the expected type of data if any (e.g. pictures? videos? blog post?) and clarify how the template consumes that information.</p>

<p>The description should also highlight the maximum number of data feeds handled by the template for datasources inputs that support multiple data feeds (in other words when the <a href="/doc/ref/package#datasource-multiple">multiple</a> option is set).</p>

<p>Here is an example manifest section for a template that features recipes and expects 3 datasource inputs:</p>
<ol>
  <li><code>recipes</code>, a blog post like feed that describes recipes.</li>
  <li><code>howtos</code>, video tutorials to learn basic cooking techniques, possibly subdivided in categories.</li>
  <li><code>wall</code>, pictures of what users prepared.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="json">"datasources": {
  "recipes": {
    "title": "Recipes",
    "description": "The list of recipes to display. The template displays the title and thumbnail of each entry, and details when the item is selected."
  },
  "howtos": {
    "title": "Cooking tutorials",
    "description": "Tutorials to learn basic cooking techniques. The template may render textual content but is more oriented towards video content. Tutorials may be grouped by topic, using one feed per topic.",
    "multiple": true
  },
  "wall": {
    "title": "Wall of fame",
    "description": "Pictures of users achievements."
  }
}</code></pre>

<h2>Fetch datasource feeds</h2>

<p>Once you have defined your datasource inputs in the manifest file, factory users can bind them to datasources feeds. You now need to write code in your template to retrieve and render them.</p>

<p>Use the <a href="/doc/ref/templateapi#datasource-find">find</a> method of the <code>datasource</code> object returned by the <a href="/doc/ref/templateapi#getDataSource">getDataSource</a> method to fetch a feed. Depending on the datasource and on factory user's choices, the <code>find</code> method may either run locally and connect directly to service providers, or proxy through a data server run by Joshfire. You do not need to worry about the method that gets used: in both cases, the data that your template will see is the same.</p>

<p>The first argument of the <code>find</code> may be used to retrieve slices of data in a set, for instance to retrieve the next 10 items, skipping the first 40 items. The options are similar to options used in <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Querying#Querying-QueryOptions">MongoDB</a>. The following example shows how to implement the "skip 40, get 10" scenario:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">var recipes = Joshfire.factory.getDataSource("recipes");
recipes.find(
  <strong>{
    limit: 10,
    skip: 40
  }</strong>,
  function (err, data) {
    // Process data entries in data.entries
  }
);</code></pre>

<p>Bear in mind that many datasource providers apply throttling limits: if you exceed the limit, the service will reject the request with a « quota exceeded » error. You should adopt a very conservative approach with datasource requests in your template, typically restricting fetch requests to user initiated actions.</p>


<h2>Deal with datasource feeds</h2>

<p>Datasource items may be coming from very different sources: Flickr, Google, Tumblr, Twitter, Youtube, identi.ca, a blog, an ical calendar, etc. If you were to follow each provider's API documentation, developing your template would basically take forever... and the resulting template would not even accept additional datasource types! Fortunately, the factory takes care of abstracting away that complexity and normalize the answers coming from these service providers.</p>

<p>The callback method that gets called when the feed becomes available is given an array of <a href="/doc/ref/datasource">datasource items</a> that represent different types of data (e.g. pictures, videos, blog posts, event). These datasource items all share the same structure, exposing the same properties whenever possible (the "name" property can always serve as title, for instance, while the "image" property may not make sense for an event).</p>

<p>In practice, the factory uses <a href="http://schema.org">schema.org</a> at its core. Schema.org provides a collection of schemas that can be used to enrich the markup of Web pages in ways recognized by major search providers. In particular, it defines a type hierarchy to describe "things" on the Web, for instance an <a href="http://schema.org/ImageObject">ImageObject</a> or a <a href="http://schema.org/Person">Person</a>. All datasource items can be thought as instances of a <a href="http://schema.org/Thing">Thing</a>.</p>

<p>Items returned in datasource feeds may be of very different types: an image, a video, a person, an article, a microblogging status, a point of interest on Earth, an event, a Web page, etc. Schema.org does not necessarily define a specialized class for each of them. The <a href="/doc/ref/datasource">datasource items reference</a> details extensions to schema.org as well as properties from other vocabularies that the factory uses.</p>

<p>Main data types that your template should expect to deal with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An <a href="http://schema.org/Article">Article</a> for RSS feed items.</li>
  <li>An <a href="http://schema.org/ImageObject">ImageObject</a> for pictures.</li>
  <li>A <a href="http://schema.org/VideoObject">VideoObject</a> for videos.</li>
  <li>An <a href="http://schema.org/Event">Event</a> for calendar items.</li>
  <li>A <a href="http://schema.org/Person">Person</a> for an item in a list of contact, an author or similar.</li>
  <li>A <a href="http://schema.org/Place">Place</a> for geolocalized content (for a list of points of interest, or through the <code>contentLocation</code> property of an Article).</li>
</ul>

<p>In your template, the item type should only serve to identify main datasource item types. You should rather react based on the presence of specific properties whenever possible for maximum flexibility.</p>

<p>Main item properties that you will use are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>name</code>: title of an article, image caption, etc.</li>
  <li><code>description</code>: a short abstract for the item.</li>
  <li><code>url</code>: a URL that serves as identifier for the item (note this URL may not be dereferenceable and should not be used to link to the item).</li>
  <li><code>itemType</code>: the specific type of the item. Note this property is not defined in schema.org. It carries the "class name" of the object.</li>
  <li><code>image</code>: an image for the item, which you can typically use as a thumbnail.</li>
  <li><code>datePublished</code>: the publication date associated with the item (ISO8601 string).</li>
</ul>

<p>Other properties may depend on the specific type of an item, such as <code>contentURL</code> to get the address of an image or <code>author</code> to get the person behind a creative work.</p>

<p>Please note that these properties may not always be set. In fact, most of the properties defined in schema.org for a specific item type won't be set in the returned feed. That's normal! Datasource providers do not expose all possible information about an item. As much as practical, your template should not rely on properties being defined.</p>

<p>The following example would render an hypothetical list of recipes:</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">var recipes = Joshfire.factory.getDataSource("recipes");
recipes.find(
  <strong>{
    limit: 10,
    skip: 40
  }</strong>,
  function (err, data) {
    // NB: you should check for err and re-assess the need
    // to render items first. We'll skip that for brevity.
    var html = "";
    _.map(data.entries, function (entry, idx) {
      html += "&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class='title'&gt;" + entry.name + "&amp;lt;/span&gt;"
        + "&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;" + entry.description;
      if (entry.image) {
        html += "&amp;lt;span class='thumbnail'&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src='"
          + entry.image.contentURL
          + "' alt='" + entry.image.name + "' /&amp;gt;"
          + "&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;";
      }
    });
    document.getElementById('entries').innerHTML = html;
  }
);</code></pre>

<p>Please note that the code in this example makes a few assumptions for brevity purpose. You should not assume that entries still need to be rendered when the callback method gets called for instance.</p>
