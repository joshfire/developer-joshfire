<h1>Submit your template</h1>

<p>So, your template is ready to ship? Good! Now it's time to take a decision about the visibility of your template.</p>

<h2 id="private">Keep a template private</h2>

<p>If you want to keep your template private, use the <em>Create new</em> button in the left pane of the templates listing page. This functionality allows you to import your template from any (private) git repository. If you followed the instructions in the <cite>Bootstrap script during template development</cite> section in the <a href="/doc/develop/start">Create template entry point(s)</a> chapter, then simply use the <em>Update from git</em> button on the details page of your private template to refresh the code when needed. If not, please note that the import works provided that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the manifest file is correct;</li>
  <li>the files the manifest links to (starting points in particular) exist;</li>
  <li>the git repository is either public or accessible by the factory (in other words, you need to add the public SSH key generated by the factory and shown on the import page to the list of SSH keys that can access the private repository).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="public">Publish a template</h2>

<p>The factory periodically refreshes the list of templates available based on the repositories of the dedicated <a href="https://github.com/joshfire-platform-templates/">Joshfire-platform-templates</a> organization on github. Publishing your template is thus a matter of ensuring your template becomes a repository of that organization.</p>

<p>This operation is manual as of today. Please get in touch at <a href="mailto:contact@joshfire.com">contact@joshfire.com</a> to submit your template. Before you submit your template, ensure that you have thoroughly tested it as a factory template using the private method explained above.</p>
