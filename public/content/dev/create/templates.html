<h1>Templates</h1>

<p>
	A template is like an empty application that you have to fill with your data. Choosing a template means choosing what your application will do and what it will look like.
<br/>
	A template is compatible with a list of device types. There are templates that are compatible with all the devices  supported by the Factory (phones, tablets, TVs, Desktops and other connected objects), but some other templates are only compatible with a given list of device types. You can choose to which device type you apply which template. An application can thus have many templates applied to it.
<br/>
	Templates are created by Joshfire or by external developers. Some of them are free of charge, others require a one-time payment.

<h2>Template list</h2>

<p>
	You can browse available templates from the template list page. Filters on the left allow you to filter by supported devices. Checking a device filter will only display templates that are at least compatible with this device.
<br/>
	You can search templates by using the Search box on the top right of the page. Search is done on keywords and title of the templates.
</p>

<p>
	You can have a quick preview of what the template looks like on real device by hovering with your mouse the device icons of a template box.
<br/>
	You can quickly see if a template requires a payment: if the template box has a "premium" label, it will require a payment later.

<h2>Template detail</h2>

<p>
	The template detail page displays a description and screenshots on supported device of the template. By reading the description, you can better understand for which usage this template has been created. Screenshots are sorted by device types and are screenshots of examples of applications built using this template, the content that you see in these screenshots will be replaced by your content
</p>

<p>
	The box on the right is important: You can select to which device you want to apply this template. Devices that are grayed are devices not supported by the template. By checking a device, and clicking "Install", you will install this template on the selected device. If you previously configured another template on this device, it will be replaced by this new template.
</p>

<p>
	The template price depends on the devices you selected. When you pay for a template you can use it in your application. You get future updates of this template for free.
</p>

<h2>Private templates</h2>
<p>
	You can import your own private template in the Factory. These imported templates will not be visible by other users. To learn more about template import, <a href="/doc/create/template-import">read this page</a>.
