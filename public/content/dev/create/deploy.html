<h1>Deploying your application</h1>

<p>
	On the "Deploy" page, you are able to build your application and send it to its final targets. For example, you are able to push your application on a web server, build it into an Android application ready to be sent to Google Play, generate the files for an Xcode project...
</p>

<p>
	After you configured them, you have to purchase the configured items if they are for charge (see the <a href="/doc/create/payment">payment page</a> for more help). Then, deploy operations are done on our servers. You do not need to install additional software or development environment to get the result of a deploy.
</p>

<p>
	Available deploy targets are listed in a list. The list is sorted by device families. For example, to deploy on TV, you can generate a TV-optimized website or build a binary application that can be distributed on the Smart TV application market.
<br/>
	A deploy target has different deploy solution possible, for example a "mobile website" can be done with "Amazon S3", "Gandi Simple Hosting"... You have to choose a deploy solution.
</p>

<p>
	Some deploys are free of charge, others require a <a href="/doc/create/payment">payment</a>. This payment can be a one-time payment, or a subscription payment. Deploys labelled as "premium" next to the "Setup" button require a payment. You can then see their price when you configure them. Free deploys have a "free" label.
</p>

<p>
	After configuring a deploy, it appears at the top of the page. Then, click the "Deploy" button. If a payment is required, a message will ask you to do so, otherwise, the operation starts and the result will be displayed on the line. Some operations can take minutes to finish (such as an iOS build).
