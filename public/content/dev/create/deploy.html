<h1>Deploying your application</h1>

<p>
	On the "Deploy" page, you are able to build your application and send it to its final targets. For example, you are able to push your application on a web server, build it into an Android application ready to be sent to Google Play, generate the files for an Xcode project...
</p>

<p>
	After you configured them, deploy operations are done on our servers. You do not need to install additional software or development environment to get the result of a deploy.

<p>
	Available deploy targets are listed in a list. The list is sorted by device families. For example, to deploy on TV, you can generate a TV-optimized website or build a binary application that can be distributed on the Smart TV application market.
<br/>
	A deploy target has different deploy solution possible, for example a "mobile website" can be done with "Amazon S3", "Gandi Simple Hosting"... You have to choose a deploy solution.
</p>

<p>
	Some deploys are free of charge, others require a payment. This payment can be a one-time payment, or a subscription payment. You can see the price of a deploy next to the "Setup" button. Free deploys have a "free" label.
