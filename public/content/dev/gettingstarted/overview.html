<h1>Factory overview</h1>

<p>The factory focuses on <strong>easy cross-device "content-based" application packaging and deployment</strong>. Factory users benefit from template developers to create Web applications without having to worry about coding and adapting the experience to multiple devices. Using the factory does not require any specific coding skills. The factory targets the public at large. In turn, the factory allows developers to sell templates and services.</p>
