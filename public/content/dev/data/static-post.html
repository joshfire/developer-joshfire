<h1>Static Post data source</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<img src="/img/data/data-icons/static-post-x80.png" alt="static HTML datasource icon" />
<p>
	The "<i>Static Post</i>" datasource lets you write a custom HTML text, by using an integrated text editor or by writting directly the HTML code.
	<br/>
	This data source is "static", this means that it doesn't fetch online content from web services: its content is created from within the Factory.
	<br/>
	It can be useful to add "about pages" to your application, for example to give contact details about your business.
</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>
	Use our simple integrated text editor to create your content from the data source configuration page. You can also manually edit the HTML code. We advise you to keep it as simple and clean as possible. Adding custom styles or tables may break the layout of the application or not integrate well with its style.
</p>

<h2>Update</h2>
<p>
	The content of such "static data source" will be shipped inside your application when you <a href="/doc/create/deploy">deploy</a> it. This means that even if you edit it from the Factory, the content is then written in your application and cannot be changed without re-publishing it.
