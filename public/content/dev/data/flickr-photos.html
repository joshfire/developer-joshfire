<p>The Flickr data source returns a list of pictures hosted on the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr website</a>.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<h3>Search by text</h3>
<p>
	Enter keywords to perform a searh on Flickr. Most recent pictures are returned first. You can also use advanced search querries such as <code>Joshfire OR factory</code>, using <code>OR</code> will search pictures with any of the given words.
<br/>
	The results are the same than on the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search">Flick Search page</a>, sorted with the "Recent" option.
</p>

<h3>Load a photo set</h3>

<p>
	We strongly advise you to create your own set to import Flickr pictures into your application, you will keep a total control on which pictures are displayed.
</p>

<p>
	The simplest way to configure a photo set is to copy and paste a photo set URL. Just go on a set page, such as <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mikiane/sets/72157628064679334/">this one</a>, and copy its web adress. It should look like this: <code>http://www.flickr.com/photos/YOURUSERNAME/sets/SETID/</code>.
</p>

<p>
	You can find your existing sets by clicking on the "You" menu then selecting "Your sets". To create a new set, you need first to upload pictures and then go to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/organize/?start_tab=sets">set organizer</a> (accessible from the "Organize & Create", and "Your sets" menu).
<br/>
	If you need more help using Flickr sets, you can visit the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/help/with/sets/">Set help page</a>.
</p>

<h3>Authentication settings</h3>
<p>
	You can preview your application without entering your Flickr API key, however, to deploy it, you need to submit your Flickr API key. To obtain an API key, follow the instructions on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html">Flickr's API Web site</a>.
<br/>
	If you already have an API key that you would like to use, you can find it in the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/account/sharing/">Your account, Sharing & Extending</a>. However, we advise to create an API key per generated application.
