<h1>iOS Build</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
	The <i>iOS build</i> deploy lets you build your application into a native iOS application. These native iOS applications can then be installed as real applications on iPhones, iPods and iPads. You must be aware of two important points:
<p>
<ul>
	<li>You should have access to an <a href="https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action">iOS developer account</a> with admin rights. Which means that you or your team will have to pay $99 per year to Apple.</li>

	<li>You will download the application but you still need to do the submission to the Apple App Store.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The App Store submission is a task that is not automated. Joshfire offers its services to do it for you, look for the "<i>App Store</i>" deploy on the deploy page.
</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>
	The four configuration parameters are very important for your application to run on your device:
</p>

<h3>Package name</h3>

<p>
	It is an unique identifier for your application, preferably in reverse URI format (such as com.[companyname].[appname]). The package name should compatible with the configuration files you have to upload next.
</p>

<h3>Certificate (p12) file and Certificate password</h3>

<p>
	If you haven't done it before, you have to create a new certificate. This operation is done using the <i>Keychain Access</i> tool on your Mac. Follow the instructions on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/my/certificates/create.action">the Certificate creation page</a>: In Keychain Access utility, select "Keychain Access > Certificate Assistant > Request a Certificate from a Certficicate Authority". Then Save this request as a file (.certSigningRequest) and upload it to your account.
<br/>
	After that the certificate has been issued by Apple, download it (it's a .cer file). Then, double click on this file, the <i>Keychain Access</i> utility opens and you should see your new certificate. Expand it, right click on the private key and select "export". This will save a .p12 file after asking for a password. It is this .p12 file and this password that you have to submit to the configuration form.

<p>
	The provisioning profile links your application to your certificates and your test devices. To create a provisioning profile, log-in with your iOS developper admin account, go to the <i>Provisioning Portal</i> and select the <i>Provisioning</i> tab.

<p>
	You will need to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/manage/bundles/howto.action">create App IDs</a> and to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/my/devices/howto.action">add devices</a> to this profile. It is very important that you select the device on which you want to test your application in the profile.
</p>


<h2>Testing your downloaded .ipa on your device</h2>

<p>
	Simply drag and drop your provisioning profile into iTunes and then drag and drop the downloaded .ipa file. The application should appear in the "<i>apps</i>" section of your iTunes "<i>Library</i>". Then, synchronize your device applications to install it on your device.
</p>

<p>
	If you cannot synchronize your device applications on this computer (because you are using iCloud for example), you can  use the official <i><a href="http://www.apple.com/support/iphone/enterprise/">iPhone Configuration Utility</a></i> software to install it: Connect your device, add your application by drag and dropping it on the window, and then click the "install" in the device's application list.

<h2>Submitting your application to Apple</h2>

<p>
	Submittion to the App Store is done using the "<i>Application Loader</i>" utility installed with Xcode. In general you find it in the path "xcode/Applications/Utilities".
