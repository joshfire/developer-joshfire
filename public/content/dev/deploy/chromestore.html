<h1>Chrome web store deploy</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
	The <i>Chrome web store</i> deploy lets you package your application for the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore">Chrome web store</a>.
	<br/>
	The Chrome web store is a marketplace of web applications that can be installed on the Chrome browser. These applications can use additional features that traditional websites cannot use, for example, running offline or being installed locally.
</p>
<p>
	The packaged application generated by the Joshfire Factory doesn't require a web server: your application will be downloaded and executed on your user's Chrome browser.
</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>
	It is recommanded to provide an <strong>icon</strong>. To do so, upload an icon to your application in the configuration tab.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Description</strong>: A text that describes briefly the application. You will be able to provide a longer description on the Chrome web app submission page. It should be plain text, no HTML or other formatting. And shouldn't be longer than 132 characters.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Version</strong>: a version number of your application. This version number should be increased at every new submission on the Chrome web store.
</p>

<h2>Testing on Google Chrome</h2>
<p>
	The Chrome browser has built-in support to test your application localy before submitting to the Chrome web store. This is done on the <a href:="chrome://extensions/">chrome://extensions/</a> page (also accessible via menus), and by clicking on “Developer Mode”, you get access to tools for adding and reloading your application. You will need to unzip the generated zip file in a folder and then to select this folder after clicking on the "<i>Load unpacked extension</i>" button.
</p>

<h2>Submitting your application to the Chrome web store</h2>
<p>
	You need to use the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard">Chrome Developer Dashboard</a> to publish your application. If you haven't already, you will be asked to pay a small fee of 5$ to open your account.
	<br/>
	The generated .zip file can then directly be uploaded to the application submission form on the Chrome Developer Dashboard.
