<h2>General</h2>

<h3>What's so special about the factory?</h3>
<p>One click. Billions of devices. The factory allows anyone to bind data feeds to connected objects through an easy-to-use interface. No coding skill required.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<h3>Do I need to use a particular license for the code of my template?</h3>
<p>No. You may choose to license the source code of your template in whatever way you like. By making your template public, you agree to the terms of use of the factory, meaning that you agree that factory users can install your template and deploy corresponding applications.</p>

<h3>Do I need to publish my template?</h3>
<p>No. You may choose to keep your template private. We strongly encourage you to publish it though, so that others may benefit and build on your ideas.</p>
